# Consolidated Troubleshoot CLI

## Goals

As Troubleshoot grows and gains new features, some of which involves flags for setting options,
and to make it easier to add additional subcommands that don't belong underneath either
`support-bundle` or `preflight` binaries, we would like to consolidate all of the Troubleshoot
commands under one binary/plugin.
